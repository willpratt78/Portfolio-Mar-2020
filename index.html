            <p>My name is Will, and I'm a travler at heart. When I'm not at school learning how to code,
                I'm out exploring my city or state. I come from a kitchen background and have always prided myself
                on my work ethic, positive attitude, and team work mentality. I've also gotten very goood at time 
                management and muti-tasking from my kitchen work as you often work in the seconds place, while having
                multiple orders or "tickets" wokring at once. Most of my past co-workers have enjoyed working with me 
                with their biggest gripe being that I <blockquote>"Offer to help too much"</blockquote>
