            </div>
            <p>My name is Will, and I'm a travler at heart. When I'm not at school learning how to code,
                I'm out exploring my city or state. I come from a kitchen background and have always prided myself
                on my work ethic, positive attitude, and team work mentality. I've also gotten very goood at time 
                management and muti-tasking from my kitchen work as you often work in the seconds place, while having
                multiple orders or "tickets" wokring at once. <em>People that have worked with me have said</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <blockquote>
                  <li><strong>When we razz on you all we can do is talk about how much you make sure everyone is doing ok.</strong></li>
                  <li>You're the only person who ever asks if all the customers were happy</li>
                  <li>You'll do anything to get the job done, come in early, stay late, and do it with a smile</li>
                  <li>I know every day I work with you is going to be great because you'll make it happen, and try to lift evryone's spirits while you do it!</li>
                </blockquote>
            </ul>
                <h3 class="center-text">Why I'm learning to code</h3>
            <p>I've been interested in coding since I was highschool and have been teaching myself on and off for 
               years with programs like code acadamy. I decided to take tht plunge and go to school after a friend
               of mine told me about this accelerated program. Despite an intense passion for food and the industry
               it's not a very sustainable carreer path with all the physical labor, late nights, and harsh 
               personalities that exsist inside of kitchens. While food will always hold a special place in 
               my heart, I believe it's time to move onto a difrent adventure that allows for more security
               in my financials and work life balance while also fulfilling my want to create a product and see an 
               end resault.
